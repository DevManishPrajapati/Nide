    "description": "The power source of the quad-rotor drone is mainly four motors. The electrical energy provided by the motor is converted into machinery to rotate the propeller of the drone to achieve flight. The motor is mainly composed of a stator, a rotor, an iron core, magnets, etc. The motors used are mainly brush motors and brushless motors. The main structure of a brushed motor includes a stator, a rotor and a brush. The brushes are in constant contact with the steering gear and play a role in conduction and commutation during rotation. They obtain rotational torque through the rotating magnetic field and output electrical energy. The main components of a brushless motor include a stator, a rotor, a position sensor and an electronic switch circuit. However, in order to reduce the weight of model aircraft and small drones, there is no position sensor in the structure of the drone, but electronics are used instead. governor. In terms of rotor type, the majority of UAV brushless motors have rotors other than rotors. Comparing the two motors, the brushed motor can work continuously for about 5,000 hours and has a service life of between 2-3 years; while the brushless motor can work continuously for more than 20,000 hours, and the service life is 2-3 times that of the brushed motor. It can be used for 7-10 years. At the same time, the brushless motor is more energy-saving, and its power consumption is only 1/3 of the brushed motor. Although the electronic switching circuit of the brushless DC motor is very complex, compared with similar products, based on considerations such as stability, operating noise, mechanical performance, electromagnetic interference, service life, power per unit volume, torque-to-weight ratio, energy consumption, etc. The BLDC motor is the mainstream choice for quadcopter drone motors. The power source of the quad-rotor UAV comes from the motor driving the rotating propeller to rotate. In the process of converting electrical energy and kinetic energy by the brushless motor, the outer rotor needs to be continuously rotated. The outer rotor is a cylinder inside which is usually a permanent rare earth magnet: (samarium cobalt) SmCo or (neodymium iron boron) NdFeBo. The stator is formed from coils wound around a polar iron core of ferromagnetic material. As current circulates through the coils, new magnetic poles are created, which interact with the rotor's permanent magnetic poles, causing the machine to spin.",
